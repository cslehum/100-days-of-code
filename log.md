# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### day 1: july 12, 2020
**todays progress**: forked the repository; go through the basics of html/css. never hurts to have a refresher about accessibility and stuff

took about 1 hour to set up this repository, read some stuff, and go through basic html and basic css functions

**what i learned**: setting up variables in plain css 
      .class{--varname: value;} 
      using it: .thing{background:var(--varname, fallbackvalue);}
      resetting: .thing{--varname: newvalue;}
      and :root = available everywhere, useful for setting up defaults for inheritance. is a pseudoclass
      I've been meaning to look up these 2 things for a while so it was handy to have here!
      
### day 2: 7.13.2020
