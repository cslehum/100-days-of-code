# some Days Of Code - Log 
starting with responsive web design certification lessons

### day 1: july 12, 2020
**todays progress**: forked the repository; go through the basics of html/css. never hurts to have a refresher about accessibility and stuff

took about 1 hour to set up this repository, read some stuff, and go through basic html and basic css functions

**what i learned**: setting up variables in plain css 
      .class{--varname: value;} 
      using it: .thing{background:var(--varname, fallbackvalue);}
      resetting: .thing{--varname: newvalue;}
      and :root = available everywhere, useful for setting up defaults for inheritance. is a pseudoclass
      I've been meaning to look up these 2 things for a while so it was handy to have here!
      
### day 2: 7.13.2020
**progress**: went through Applied Visual Design section. didn't quite take an hour but i'm tired anyway. learned some cool stuff with gradients and animations

### 7/13, 7/14, 7/15
i spent all work day in css, html and vue code and couldn't sit in front of the computer longer. reinforced learning in componentizing vue setup; found a neat, detailed sass mixin for media queries, and  learned something else sass i don't recall at the moment, lol

### 7/20
working through accessibilty lessons, like this one: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/wrap-radio-buttons-in-a-fieldset-element-for-better-accessibility. Wondering why we don't use legends for surveys at work.
